Glow began as a command-line markdown viewer. 

I would like Glow to become the best document reader on CLI, and its capability is to expand to open all sorts of documents. I want Glow to help a user navigate, read, search, and query very long documents that may otherwise be very difficult to read or may take a long time to read.

Glow should remain fast.
